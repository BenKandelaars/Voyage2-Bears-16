# Bears-16 Tier III Project

The repository will soon host a result of glorious endeavour of a particularly ambitious Chingu cohort called by some "Bears-16".

This small group of developers joined their forces in effort to create and reverse engineer one of the top website on the web today - AirBnB.

Their righteous attempt is bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
