# Bears-16 Tier III Project

The repository will soon host a result of a glorious endeavour. Done by a particularly ambitious Chingu cohort, called by some "Bears-16".

This small group of developers joined their forces in effort to create and reverse engineer one of the top website on the web today - [AirBnB.com](https://airbnb.com/).

Their relentlessness could be matched only with the sheer amount of tea, coffee, energy drinks and other liquids consumed during September and October of Anno Domini 2017... this is their story (in the making).
